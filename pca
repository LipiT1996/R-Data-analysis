#Principle component analysis on Hitters data.

Preprocessing the data
library(ISLR)
dim(Hitters)

Removing the N/A values.
Hitters <- na.omit(Hitters)

Converting names of the player into numbers for better results in the biplot.
row.names(Hitters)= 1:263

Creating dummy representation of the catagorical data in the data, predictors having catagorical data are league, division and new league
Hitters$League <- ifelse(Hitters$League=="N", 1, 2)
Hitters$Division <- ifelse(Hitters$Division=="W", 1, 2)
Hitters$NewLeague <- ifelse(Hitters$NewLeague=="N", 1, 2)

Now, salary is the response and rest variables are predictors. We wont consider salary. So the matrix becomes 263x19.
library(dplyr)
train = select(Hitters, -Salary)
dim(train)

Does the data require standardization? 
apply(train, 2, mean)
apply(train, 2, sd) 

YES, the data need to be standardized, as the variables scales vary significantly.

PCA, TABLES AND GRAPH
head(train)
str(train)
pca <- prcomp(train, center = T, scale = T)
summary(pca)

pc.var <- pca$sdev^2
pve <- pc.var/sum(pc.var)
pve
cumsum(pve)
